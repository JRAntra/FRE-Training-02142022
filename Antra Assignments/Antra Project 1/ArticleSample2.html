                        <h2>John 12:36-50</h2>

                        <p class="article__body__script"><sup>36</sup> <q>Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.</q> When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.

                        Belief and Unbelief Among the Jews <sup>37</sup> Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. <sup>38</sup> This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet: 
                        <q>Lord, who has believed our message
                            and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”[a] 
                            <sup>39</sup> For this reason they could not believe, because, as Isaiah says elsewhere:

                        <sup>40</sup> “He has blinded their eyes
                        and hardened their hearts,
                        so they can neither see with their eyes,
                        nor understand with their hearts,
                        nor turn—and I would heal them.[b]</q>



                        <sup>41</sup> Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.

                        <sup>42</sup> Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue; <sup>43</sup> for they loved human praise more than praise from God.

                        <sup>44</sup> Then Jesus cried out, <q>Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. <sup>45</sup> The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me. <sup>46</sup> I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness.</q>

                        <sup>47</sup> <q>If anyone hears my words but does not keep them, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. <sup>48</sup> There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day. <sup>49</sup> For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken. <sup>50</sup> I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.</q></p>
                        
                        <div class="art__body--trans">

                            <h2>Living in Ignorance</h2>

                            <p>We talked about Jesus’ death where Jesus predicted the situation that He will be glorified – to be put to death on the cross in complete obedience to the Father. His sacrifice on the cross not only give glory to the Father, but the Father will glorify the Son for people to believe in the Son. The glory that is brought about Christ’s sacrifice on the cross is the payment for our sins that reveal the glory of God in Jesus Christ. It is the redeeming act once and for all for mankind, to take away our sins. Furthermore, we understood that Jesus is emphasizing to the people to walk with Him, for God’s plan is for people to become children of the light: the true believers, worshipers of God.</p>

                            <p>Today, we see a contrast concerning what we discussed today, the context showed us the following outline:</p>

                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>Jesus emphasized believing in Him – The Light of the World (v.36)</li>
                                <li>God foreknew people’s unbelief – the hardening of their hearts and minds (v.37-41)</li>
                                <li>What does it mean to believe (v.41-43)?</li>
                                <li>Jesus reiterates His purpose and ministry (v.44-46)</li>
                                <li>The condemnation of those who reject Christ (v.47-50)</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Jesus Emphasized believing in Him - the Light of the World</h3>

                            <p>Let us take note as to what Jesus said:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Believe in the light while you have the light, so that you may become children of light.” When he had finished speaking, Jesus left and hid himself from them.</q></i> - John 12:36</blockquote>

                            <p>When we pay attention to this statement, Christ is telling the people to believe in Him. Christ also refers to the people who believe in Him as children of the Light, God’s children. We saw so many references regarding this because we see the following verses as to what kind of children are they:</p>

                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>Christ describes His children as true worshipers that worship God in Spirit and truth (v. John 4:23-24)</li>
                                <li>God’s children will have eternal life (v. John 5:24, 6:38, 8;12, 9:36-49, 10:17)</li>
                                <li>God’s children have a deep relationship with them just as He has with His Father (John 10:14-15)</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>All these are examples of people who are living in the light, who has believed in Jesus. The important part of this section is Christ emphasizes the importance of believing in Him. It is not just lip service or spur of the moment. What God desires is His children to have a relationship that is changed, reflective and conduit of His grace, mercy, love, holiness, and His word.</p>


                            <h3>God foreknew People’s Unbelief (v.37-41)</h3>

                            <p>However, John highlighted an especially important contrast to what Jesus have said:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him.</q></i> - John 12:37</blockquote>

                            <p>This cannot get plain than this: people desire more of themselves instead of God. We see this historically about Israel and the world today that even when Jesus showed and revealed Himself to them, they do not know Him as God. The book of Romans in its first chapter refer to this as ignorance, for although they knew God (Yahweh) in the Old Testament, they never acknowledge who He is. We see it in scripture that the people will continue to turn to their wickedness and ignorance, and they Lost the chance of knowing that Jesus is the Messiah prophesied even in the beginning of time.</p>

                            <p>John quoted important scripture from the prophet Isaiah. The first one is the following:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?</q></i> - Isaiah 53:1</blockquote>

                            <p>This quotation from Isaiah mentioned in verse 38 gives us a context of why the people do not recognized Jesus. Even before Isaiah 53 started, Isaiah 52 prophesies about Jesus but not in the way that people would think. Isaiah writes:</p> 

                            <blockquote><i><q>See, my servant will act wisely; he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted. Just as there were many who were appalled at him – his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any human being and his form marred beyond human likeness so he will sprinkle many nations and kings will shut their mouths because of him. For what they were not told, they will see, and what they have not heard, they will understand!</q></i> - Isaiah 52:13-15</blockquote>

                            <p>This section in Isaiah refers to Jesus Christ dying on the cross for the payment of our sins, but Isaiah continued in chapter 53 with the following:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.</q></i> - Isaiah 53:2</blockquote>

                            <p>They did not recognize Christ because the world does not see how God sees things. Notice what Jesus said prior in John 8:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I have come here from God. I have not come on my own; God sent me. Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say</q></i> - John 8:42-43</blockquote>

                            <p>We get answers as to why they are not able to understand which was mentioned in verse 40:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Make the heart of this people calloused; make their ears dull and close their eyes. Otherwise, they might see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their hears and turn and be healed</q></i> - Isaiah 6:10</blockquote>

                            <p>Because of the people’s ignorance, because of sin, God had ordained for the heart of man to be calloused, not hearing and not seeing. God who has seen detestable things man has done even in the beginning when God made Adam foreknew that those people will ignore Him and live in sin.  That is why Jesus came down to reveal who God is and fulfilled His promise which refers Christ’s sacrifice on the cross:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>And I when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself.</q></i> - John 12:32</blockquote>

                            <h3>What does It mean to Believe?(v.42-43)</h3>

                            <p>When believing in Jesus, what does it mean to truly believe in Him? Let’s go back to our passage in verse 42-43:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him. But because of the Pharisees they would not openly acknowledge their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue, for they loved human praise more than praise from God.</q></i> - John 12:42-43</blockquote>

                            <p>So, here we see that John highlighted that some people who believed in Jesus. This is important to notice because some of the leaders believed in Jesus Christ. However, they were fearful of the Pharisees. Extremely influential, the Pharisees have religio-sociogical influences and sometimes political influences. So, the people who decided to follow Christ still deals with the fear of being persecuted by the Pharisees which results to their silence. John specifically mentioned that these people who were described who believed but kept silent are people who love human praise than God’s (v.43). There are many Christians today who, out of fear, keep silent about their faith. There are people who continue in a life not proclaiming the good news. Matthew 28:19-20 is the mandate of the believer to go the world and proclaim the good news that is in Jesus Christ:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always to the very end of the age.</q></i> - Matthew:28:19-20</blockquote>

                            <p>When Jesus talks to His disciples, followers, or believers, it is mandate for them to go (in absolution) and make disciples. It is the reflection of the saved to follow God’s commands. Faith comes first then obedience next. That’s why we are reminded in the book of James that the redeeming sacrifice of the Savior must be seen in the life that we are living. </p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, “Go in peace keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.</q></i> - James 2:14-17</blockquote>

                            <p>When God speaks, just like in the creation of the world, things come into existence. The Christian life is similar that when Jesus speaks and His words and commands are given to us, that life becomes the expression of God’s love. Those who believe are testimonies of Jesus’ grace and love for us, for God’s Spirit, His word lives in us.</p>

                            <p>Therefore, the ultimate expression of believing and being redeemed is a life centered by faith in Jesus, and their lives mirrors the grace, mercy, and love of God.</p>

                            <h3>Jesus’ Purpose and Ministry(v.44-47)</h3>

                            <p>Pay attention to what Jesus says here:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Then Jesus cried out, “Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me. The one who looks at me is seeing the one who sent me. I have come into the world as a light, so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness. If anyone hears my words, I do not judge that person. For I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</q></i> - John 12:44-47</blockquote>

                            <p>So, Christ once again shows His love for His people to emphasize His purpose, but it also reflects the heart of the Father – sending His Son for people to believe. We see these in previous scripture reflected not only in John but once again referring to the book of Isaiah:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.</q></i> - Isaiah 53:10-11</blockquote>

                            <p>Even before this verse the Lord Jesus was prophesied to suffer (Isaiah 53:4-9), and It is Christ who bore that weight. We see the love of God in its fullness in Jesus Christ. It is in Him that we have now a relationship with Him. It is through Christ the God’s will of redemption is fulfilled, and even to this day, God is always at work and drawing people to Him. When we talked about Jesus’ purpose, Christ mentioned this in the past chapters that we have studied:</p>

                            <ol type="1">
                                <li>The Good Shepherd that is Jesus Christ lays His life down on His own accord to save His sheep – The command He received from the Father (v. John 10:14-18) - The heart of the Father is for His Son to die as a redeeming sacrifice for sin </li>
                                <li>Jesus is the Resurrection and the Life - The life that Jesus give is the life which stems to eternal life. A life that is transformed in the grace, mercy, and love of God (v. John 11:25-26)</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>These are just examples of what Jesus refers to concerning His purpose and ministry. Conclusively, the purpose and ministry of Christ continues, for the ministry that Jesus started is the same ministry that we His disciples are mandated to do: to preach the Gospel that God has sent His Son to the world to redeem and judge us.</p>

                            <h3>The Condemnation of those who Reject Jesus Christ (v.48-50)</h3>

                            <p>However, judgement is to come to the world, and Christ words is already judgement to those people who reject and ignore Him:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>There is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words; the very words I have spoken will condemn them at the last day. For I did not speak on my own, but the Father who sent me commanded me to say all that I have spoken. I know that his command leads to eternal life. So whatever I say is just what the Father has told me to say.</q></i> - John 12:48-50</blockquote>

                            <p>In this section, Christ said that He is not judging the world, but He is there to save the world. However, there will be judgement for those who reject Him. We see this in the following verses prior to John 12. For example, let’s read John 5:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Moreover, the Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgement to the Son, that  all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not Honor the Father who sent Him</q></i> - John 5:22-23</blockquote>

                            <p>In this text, we notice that Jesus is the judge. Although during this time, He does not cast His judgement yet, but before the cross and Christ’s words, which is the Bible, everyone will be judge. We all see here that the Father wills His Son to judge. Paul, in context of condemnation and judgement, the Lord Jesus proclaims:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin, he will see his offspring and prolong his days and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand. After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.</q></i> - Isaiah 53:10-11</blockquote>

                            <p>The book of Romans speaks volumes of God’s wrath that will devour humanity and it will be a day that all people will give an account for their actions:</p>

                            <blockquote><i><q>I myself will call to account anyone who does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name</q></i> - Deuteronomy 18:19</blockquote>

                            <h3>Application Lessons</h3>

                            <p>So, what can we learn from all this? Let’s enumerate those lessons:</p>

                            <ol type="1">
                                <li><b>Jesus Christ is the Light of the world. Therefore, we are to show Jesus to others</b> - Jesus is the truth, and that He is Light of the world. We are testimonies of His light that we are now living. Jesus has revealed to us that in Him is fullness and completeness that we won’t desire anything more because of who He is. Declaring Him as our Lord and Savior means He is the center of everything that we do.</li>
                                <li><b>Believing is not just by word, but it is also by deed</b> - Let’s take our time and pay attention to the things that we do. Is there anything Christ like with regards of what we’re doing? This question asks us as a litmus test to determine if Jesus is the center of our lives. If He is not, then we need to come clean to God, ask His forgiveness and surrender ourselves to Him. If He is the center of our lives, are there some areas that Christ is working on? If there are any, surrender those things at His feet, and ask God’s mercy that may He continue to mold us to be like Him</li>
                                <li><b>Live in the grace and mercy of Christ</b> - Everyday, we get to live our lives, but it is nothing before Jesus. We continue to live realizing what grace and mercy God lavished upon us, His people, and we live everyday for Jesus’ sake. This emphasizes that Jesus changes His people to be more like Him, walking in complete obedience, and with gratitude worship the Lord our God because of the compassion, grace, mercy, and love that the Lord has given us.</li>
