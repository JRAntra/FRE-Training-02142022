Javascript (Instructor: Yue Dong)

The Difference of Let, var, and const

var  - is a functional scope.
hoisting - move it / declare it at the top.

Javascript runs the program line by line.

let keyword - A must be hoisted
You cannot use a variable if not initialized first. if empty value, let will declare cannot access while variable's output will be undefined

let and const have the same function, but let is can only be used within a block. let can also be reassign.

const - cannot be reassigned

functions are hoisted top.

highly suggest using let and const.

coercion tries to change the datatype to process the data

Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

Javascript is designed as functional programming - ES6

Encapsulation - it is a feature in programming 

Inheritance - inherit the properties of classes

Polymorphism - having many forms

Can I Use website is for front-end developers

# sign is a private data.

Javascript Arrays
for loops
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {}

    for (let i in arr){
        console.log(arr[i]);
    }

.map will return something, but for each will retunr nothing

continue jumps over one iteration in the loop

break jumpst out of a loop

.filter - filters the array to find the a data

.reduce - has two arguments (call back function, initacc)

Assignment is to make my own reducer

Spread operator && rest parameters

spread is a parameter that are triple dots... rest should be in the last part of the argument.
